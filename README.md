# A greta-R implementation of the MCMC approach for radiological characterization of radioactive waste drums by SCK CEN

## Content

Besides the original MCMC code by [Laloy et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apradiso.2021.109803), this repo contains the Dirichlet priors, Gaussian process prior, and hierarchical modeling proposed by [Laloy et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07786). 
The considered measurement techniques are segmented gamma scanning (SGS) and passive neutron coincidence counting (PNCC).
